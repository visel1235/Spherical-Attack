# Spherical-Attack
This is my first "playable" game,(do note that it is a development build). Which is a tower defense game, though totally unbalanced and unoptimized. (How To) Put all files in a folder, and make a shortcut for the Exe file with Spherical Attack spelled incorrectly(for quick acces). Please leave suggestions and what should be balanced in issues
And don't be to critical, since its an early build.
